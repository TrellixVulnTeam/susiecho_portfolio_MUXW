                    <p class="content_text_en">Hello, this is a product designer, Susie Cho. First of all, thank you for visiting my space.</p>
                    <div class="space-shortest"></div>
                    <p class="content_text_en">I have experienced in product design in Korea from 2015 to 2017 and Vietnam from 2017 to 2020. After coming to Korea, I planned the gap year at the beginning of the 6th year of this field. Then, I am currently spending the last quarter of the gap year. Now, I am standing at the start line with full energy.</p>
                    <div class="space-shortest"></div>
                    <p class="content_text_en">I like the process of listening to and empathizing with the problem, finding the answer to the problem. Moreover, I'm fond of creating results by thinking about the 'why' and 'how'. And I love how the multiple people involved in this process work together towards the best outcome in an efficient way.
                    </p>
                    <div class="space-shortest"></div>
                    <p class="content_text_en">I like to think of myself as a full-stack product designer who can collaborate and lead from the research and design to the evaluation phase of a project and make it seamless for developers to develop.</p>

                    <p class="content_text_en">I am not picky about food, but I have to eat Korean food I made regularly, and that's the most delicious for me. When I want to eat Korean food in a foreign country, or when I want to eat food that is not sold in our neighborhood in Korea, I should make it! </p>
                    <p class="content_text_en">When I cook when I'm stuck with my thoughts, I feel refreshed because I need to think about the efficiency route and focus on setting the order in which I need to do it. The quick results are also attractive.</p>

                    <p class="content_text_en">A morning that begins with a record, an evening that finishes with a record. I'm not as good as those who write and organize perfectly and beautifully by subject, but I have my own rules that I've made based on my failures for a long time.</p>
                    <p class="content_text_en">I organize the accumulated data for a year into several themes every year, but I haven't found the answer to my life yet. But one day, as these failures pile up, I will have a stronger identity. I think I could be an autonomous person more.</p>

                    <p class="content_text_kr">When I want to completely rest my brain I just turn it off and surf the internet in today's world.</p>

                    <p class="content_text_en">The joy of running at the same time every day and being able to run a little more than yesterday. Running is possible only if we have the strength to do something consistently, and repetitions allow us to run a little longer and more leisurely.</p>
                    <p class="content_text_en">Many people said that life is like a marathon, tomorrow I will practice running one more step with more scenery.</p>
